# Symbiosis Protocol - Game Pitch

ABOUTME: Game pitch for space station management hosting incompatible alien biologies

## Title & Concept Summary
**Symbiosis Protocol** - Manage a space station that serves as a neutral meeting ground for dozens of alien species, each with radically different biology, requiring you to engineer impossible compromises between incompatible life support needs.

## Core Gameplay Loop
Design and reconfigure modular station sections to accommodate visiting alien delegations whose environmental needs are often mutually exclusive - species that require methane atmospheres meeting with beings who combust in methane. Players solve spatial puzzles, invent technological workarounds, and negotiate biological compromises to keep diplomatic missions running smoothly while preventing accidental genocide through environmental mishaps.

## Player Experience Goals
**Creative Engineering**: The satisfaction of solving seemingly impossible technical challenges through clever design and resource management. **Cultural Mediation**: Experience the complexity of bridging not just different cultures, but entirely different forms of life. **Escalating Complexity**: Each successful diplomatic meeting unlocks access to more exotic species with increasingly bizarre requirements.

## Key Systems & Mechanics
- **Modular Architecture**: Real-time station reconfiguration with rooms that can be sealed, pressurized, heated, cooled, or filled with different atmospheric compositions.
- **Biological Constraints Matrix**: A complex system where each species has specific requirements (temperature, pressure, gravity, atmosphere, radiation levels, time cycles) that must be satisfied without harming other species.
- **Diplomatic Reputation**: Success builds trust with different species coalitions, unlocking new technologies and more challenging diplomatic scenarios, while failures can lead to interstellar incidents.

## Inspirations & Differentiation
Draws from **Spacechem's** engineering puzzles, **Papers Please's** bureaucratic decision-making, and **The Martian's** survival engineering. Unlike existing space management games, this focuses on biological diversity as the primary challenge rather than resource scarcity or combat, creating puzzle scenarios that haven't been explored in gaming.

## Technical Considerations
- **Complex constraint satisfaction** algorithms needed for automatically validating station configurations
- **Procedural alien generation** system to create species with novel but consistent biological requirements
- **3D spatial reasoning** interface that remains intuitive despite complexity
- **Scalability** - station complexity could grow exponentially with more species

## Stretch Goals
Expand into full galactic diplomacy simulator where successful station management leads to mediating larger interstellar conflicts. Add species evolution mechanics where your decisions influence how alien cultures develop over time. Potential educational partnership with astrobiology researchers to explore real extremophile biology.
