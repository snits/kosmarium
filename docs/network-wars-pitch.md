# Network Wars: The Living World
## Complete Game Pitch Document

---

## Executive Summary

**Network Wars: The Living World** is a multiplayer grand strategy game where players build and manage dynamic networks across an evolving planetary ecosystem. Unlike traditional strategy games with static maps, our world literally changes beneath you - climate shifts reshape coastlines, mountain ranges rise and fall, and your carefully planned infrastructure must adapt or perish.

Players win not by conquering territory, but by building the most resilient and adaptive network systems. Every mountain that erodes, every river that changes course, every climate zone that shifts creates new strategic opportunities and threatens existing plans. The game combines the strategic depth of Civilization with the emergent complexity of Dwarf Fortress, delivered through a uniquely responsive living world.

**Target Market**: Strategy gamers aged 25-45 seeking deeper, more meaningful gameplay experiences
**Platform**: PC (Steam), with mobile companion app for network monitoring
**Development Timeline**: 36 months, $2.5M budget
**Revenue Model**: Premium ($49.99) + DLC content packs + optional cosmetics

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### The Living World Foundation

The game world operates on accelerated geological time (1 game year = 1000 real years) with authentic environmental systems:

- **Terrain Evolution**: Mountain building, erosion, river network changes, coastal shifts
- **Climate Dynamics**: Temperature and precipitation patterns that respond to terrain and orbital cycles  
- **Ecosystem Response**: Biome boundaries shift based on climate, creating resource availability changes

This creates the fundamental strategic tension: **How do you build permanent infrastructure in an impermanent world?**

### Network-Based Victory

Victory comes from building the most effective **Network Efficiency Score** over time:

- **Connectivity Points**: How well your network connects resource nodes, population centers, and strategic locations
- **Resilience Multiplier**: How well your network survives environmental changes and adapts to new conditions
- **Innovation Bonus**: Benefits gained from connecting diverse regions and facilitating knowledge transfer

### Core Gameplay Loop

**Turn Structure (Each turn = 10 game years = ~2 minutes real time)**

1. **Environmental Update Phase**: 
   - World evolves based on geological/climate models
   - Players receive "Change Reports" highlighting new opportunities and threats
   - Emergency events may require immediate responses

2. **Network Planning Phase**:
   - Analyze new world state and identify optimal connections
   - Plan infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, canals, communications)
   - Allocate resources between expansion, maintenance, and adaptation

3. **Construction Phase**:
   - Build new network elements
   - Upgrade existing infrastructure 
   - Repair or relocate infrastructure damaged by environmental changes

4. **Network Activation Phase**:
   - Resources and information flow through your networks
   - Generate income and research based on network efficiency
   - Gain strategic intelligence about other players' networks

### Strategic Depth Mechanisms

**Adaptive Infrastructure Types**:
- **Rigid Infrastructure** (Stone roads, major bridges): High capacity, vulnerable to change
- **Flexible Infrastructure** (Trade routes, temporary bridges): Lower capacity, adapts automatically
- **Smart Infrastructure** (Advanced communications, modular systems): Expensive but self-optimizing

**Resource Management**:
- **Physical Resources**: Stone, metal, timber (location-dependent, shift with environmental changes)
- **Human Resources**: Population, expertise, cultural knowledge (migrate with climate/opportunity)
- **Information**: Maps, technology, network intelligence (competitive advantage through better world understanding)

**Technology Trees**:
- **Engineering**: Better infrastructure, more efficient construction
- **Earth Sciences**: Predict environmental changes, identify new resources
- **Communications**: Faster information flow, coordinate distant networks
- **Adaptation**: Technologies that help infrastructure survive change

## Competitive Balance

### Anti-Snowball Mechanics

**Environmental Equalizers**:
- Major geological events periodically "reset" advantages (volcanic eruptions, glaciation periods)
- Climate cycles favor different network strategies over time
- Resource nodes shift location as geology evolves

**Adaptive Advantages**:
- Players who fall behind get "Innovation Desperation" bonuses for risky adaptive technologies
- Environmental changes often favor different network philosophies in different eras
- Late-game technologies allow rapid network reconfiguration

**Strategic Rock-Paper-Scissors**:
- **Centralized Networks** (hub-and-spoke): Efficient but fragile
- **Distributed Networks** (mesh): Resilient but expensive 
- **Opportunistic Networks** (following resources): Adaptive but unstable

### Tension Maintenance

**Prediction vs Adaptation Dilemma**:
- Investing in Earth Sciences lets you predict changes but costs resources
- Building adaptive infrastructure is expensive but responds automatically
- Rigid infrastructure is cheap but requires manual management

**Cooperation vs Competition**:
- Shared infrastructure projects provide mutual benefits but create dependencies
- Information trading helps everyone understand the world but advantages competitors
- Emergency mutual aid during disasters builds trust but reveals weaknesses

**Time Pressure Mechanics**:
- Some environmental changes happen gradually (plan ahead)
- Others are sudden catastrophic events (test existing resilience)
- Regular "Efficiency Evaluation" periods create scoring deadlines
