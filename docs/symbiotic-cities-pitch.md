# Symbiotic Cities - Game Pitch

ABOUTME: Game pitch for cooperative urban planning with interdependent neighborhoods

## Title & Concept Summary
**Symbiotic Cities** - Players co-manage interconnected neighborhoods where each district's prosperity depends entirely on the wellbeing of neighboring communities, forcing collaborative urban planning across competing interests.

## Core Gameplay Loop
Each player governs a distinct neighborhood with unique resources, needs, and cultural characteristics (artists' quarter, industrial zone, residential suburbs, tech district, etc.). No neighborhood can thrive in isolation - the artists need housing from residential players, industry needs cultural vibrancy, tech needs both talent and manufacturing. Players must negotiate resource sharing, joint infrastructure projects, and policy decisions that affect multiple districts simultaneously. Success is measured by overall city health rather than individual district metrics.

## Player Experience Goals
- Experience genuine interdependence where others' success directly enables your own
- Develop skills in negotiation, compromise, and long-term relationship building
- Understand complex systems thinking through urban planning metaphors
- Create emergent political narratives through player-driven governance decisions

## Key Systems & Mechanics
- **Symbiotic Resource Flows**: Each district produces surplus of certain resources but has critical dependencies on others; hoarding triggers city-wide cascading failures
- **Collective Infrastructure**: Major projects (transit systems, utilities, cultural centers) require multi-district investment and ongoing cooperation to maintain
- **Dynamic Crisis Management**: Environmental, economic, or social challenges affect multiple districts differently, requiring coordinated emergency response and mutual aid

## Inspirations & Differentiation
Builds on "SimCity's" urban planning and "Diplomacy's" negotiation mechanics, but eliminates zero-sum competition in favor of positive-sum cooperation. Unlike city builders focused on individual optimization, success requires understanding and supporting other players' distinct needs and constraints.

## Technical Considerations
Needs robust real-time negotiation tools, visual systems for tracking complex resource interdependencies, and asynchronous play support for different time zones. Scalable from 4-8 players for intimate cooperation up to 20+ for complex metropolitan governance.
