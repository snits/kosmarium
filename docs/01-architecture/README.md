### 2. Scale-Aware Architecture
**Status**: Implemented and validated
- Eliminate all hardcoded thresholds, use continuous scaling functions
- Single implementation works from 1km to 40,000km domains
- No artificial boundaries or step-function artifacts
- Physically consistent behavior at all scales

### 3. Physics-First System Integration
**Status**: Atmospheric physics complete, ready for other systems
- Implement proper physics rather than approximations
- Root cause analysis eliminates entire classes of artifacts
- Educational value requires scientific accuracy
- Long-term maintainability through principled implementation

### 4. Diagnostic-Driven Development
**Status**: Framework established and proven
- Build comprehensive diagnostic frameworks alongside physics systems
- Early detection of physics violations during development
- Quantitative validation of improvements
- Enables confident refactoring and optimization

### 5. Trait-Based System Architecture
**Status**: Core foundation established
- Use Rust traits for polymorphic physics and scale behavior
- Clear separation of concerns between systems
- Easy testing with mock implementations
- Extensible for future physics systems and algorithms

## Architecture Quality Metrics
