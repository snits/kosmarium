# Drift Protocol - Game Pitch

ABOUTME: Game pitch for asymmetric co-op space station repair game
ABOUTME: Generated by simulation-designer for internal pitch experiment

## Title & Concept Summary
**Drift Protocol** - An asymmetric co-op game where one player controls a damaged AI system while 2-4 others play as crew members trying to repair their failing space station before it drifts into a black hole.

## Core Gameplay Loop
The AI player sees system diagnostics, power flows, and threat predictions but can only communicate through terminal messages, door controls, and environmental systems. Crew players navigate physical spaces, repair components, and solve emergencies while interpreting cryptic AI guidance. Each 15-20 minute round escalates through cascading system failures until either successful repair or catastrophic drift.

## Player Experience Goals
**Tension through miscommunication** - The thrill of trying to coordinate under pressure when information is fragmented. **Asymmetric empathy** - Each role feels essential but fundamentally different. **Emergent storytelling** - Every failed repair attempt and successful save creates memorable moments of teamwork or tragic misunderstanding.

## Key Systems & Mechanics
1. **Information Asymmetry Engine** - AI sees the "why" (system states, predictions) while crew sees the "what" (physical damage, immediate threats)
2. **Cascading Failure Simulation** - Realistic system dependencies where fixing one thing can break another, requiring constant priority negotiation
3. **Communication Constraints** - AI's limited interaction methods force creative problem-solving in how to convey complex information

## Inspirations & Differentiation
Inspired by **Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes** (asymmetric info), **FTL** (system management), and **Among Us** (social deduction). Differentiates through genuine cooperation vs. competition, longer-form sessions building relationships between players, and technical systems that feel authentically "spaceship-like" rather than gamey.

## Technical Considerations
**Real-time networking** with 5 players requires robust synchronization. **Dynamic UI generation** for AI player's diagnostic displays. **Physics simulation** for realistic system interactions and damage propagation. **Voice chat integration** essential for crew coordination.

## Stretch Goals or Long-Term Vision
**Procedural station generation** for infinite replay value. **Campaign mode** where successful crews can upgrade their station and tackle harder scenarios. **Modding support** for custom station layouts and failure scenarios.
