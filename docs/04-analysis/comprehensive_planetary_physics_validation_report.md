## Critical Physics Issues

### Issue #1: Buoyancy Coefficient Dimensional Error ⚠️

**Problem**: Thermal circulation buoyancy coefficient treats acceleration as velocity
- Current: 0.03 m/s per °C  
- Should be: ~0.34 m/s² per °C (factor of ~10 error)

**Physics**: Buoyancy acceleration a = g(ΔT/T₀), then velocity v ~ √(aL)

**Fix**: Replace direct multiplication with proper buoyancy physics:
```rust
// Current (incorrect):
let thermal_velocity = buoyancy_coefficient * temp_difference;

// Corrected:
let buoyancy_acceleration = gravity * (temp_difference / reference_temperature);
let thermal_velocity = (buoyancy_acceleration * characteristic_length).sqrt();
```

**Impact**: Medium - affects thermal circulation magnitudes but not overall physics validity

## Methodology Validation

### Three-Tool Analytical Approach: HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ✅

**Sequential-Thinking**: Provided systematic analysis structure across 12 thought steps, enabling comprehensive coverage of all physics domains without missing critical components.

**Metis (SageMath)**: Enabled quantitative validation with 8 separate computational analyses, including energy balance verification, conservation law checking, and parameter validation against Earth observations.
