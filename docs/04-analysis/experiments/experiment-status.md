# Pitch Experiment Status

ABOUTME: Tracking document for internal pitch experiment progress
ABOUTME: Records completion status and next steps for agent-generated game concept evaluation

## Experiment Overview
Testing whether design agents can generate compelling game ideas for internal development team evaluation and potentially prototype selection.

## Phase 1: Design Agent Pitch Generation âœ… COMPLETE

### Participating Agents
- **game-design-strategist** âœ…
- **simulation-designer** âœ…  
- **social-systems-designer** âœ…

### Generated Pitches (6 total)

#### game-design-strategist
1. **Memory Palace** (`docs/memory-palace-pitch.md`) - Digital therapy assistant navigating patients' mindscapes to reorganize traumatic memories
2. **Symbiosis Protocol** (`docs/symbiosis-protocol-pitch.md`) - Space station management hosting incompatible alien biologies through diplomatic engineering

#### simulation-designer  
3. **Drift Protocol** (`docs/drift-protocol-pitch.md`) - Asymmetric co-op where AI player guides crew members repairing failing space station
4. **The Archivist** (`docs/the-archivist-pitch.md`) - Contemplative single-player AI reconstructing lost human knowledge through environmental puzzles

#### social-systems-designer
5. **Memory Weavers** (`docs/memory-weavers-pitch.md`) - Collective AI memory reconstruction requiring players to share authentic personal experiences
6. **Symbiotic Cities** (`docs/symbiotic-cities-pitch.md`) - Cooperative urban planning with interdependent neighborhoods requiring genuine collaboration

### Technical Notes
- Initial parallel agent execution caused silent failures
- Sequential execution with shorter prompts resolved social-systems-designer issues
- All agents successfully followed pitch framework structure
- Creative range exceeded expectations - from therapy games to space management to urban planning

## Phase 2: Implementation Team Ranking ðŸ”„ PENDING

### Planned Evaluation Process
- **Sequential agent evaluation** (lessons learned from Phase 1)
- **Implementation team agents**: senior-engineer, systems-architect, performance-engineer, security-engineer, etc.
- **Evaluation criteria**: Technical feasibility, interesting challenges, team capability alignment, prototype potential

### Next Steps After Intermission
1. Select first implementation agent for ranking
2. Provide all 6 pitches for evaluation
3. Collect ranking with technical feasibility assessment
4. Continue sequentially through implementation team
5. Aggregate rankings and identify consensus/disagreement patterns

## Multi-Scale Agent Architecture Analysis âœ… COMPLETE

### Concurrent Investigation Results
- **simulation-designer**: "Brilliant" - polymorphic behaviors, event aggregation patterns, hierarchical state machines
- **systems-architect**: Build on existing ScaleAware patterns, 900 agents manageable, staggered updates
- **data-architect**: Solid foundation, needs hierarchical spatial indexing, on-demand loading for memory scaling
- **social-systems-designer**: Complete framework for individual/tribal/national social dynamics (file: `docs/multi-scale-social-analysis.md`)

### Key Technical Insights
- **10Hz simulation rate** (not 60fps) makes agent updates much more feasible
- Universal 300-agent budget across scales with different update frequencies
- Event-driven architecture for cross-scale communication
- Build incrementally on existing `ScaleAware` and spatial partitioning patterns

## Experiment Insights So Far
- Design agents generated genuinely creative, non-obvious game concepts
- No overlap between agents despite unconstrained creative freedom
- Each agent's specialization clearly influenced their pitch types
- Framework structure produced consistently actionable, well-reasoned pitches
- Sequential execution more reliable than parallel for complex creative tasks
- Multi-scale agent architecture shows strong feasibility across multiple specialist perspectives
