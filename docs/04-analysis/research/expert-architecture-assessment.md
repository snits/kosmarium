## ⚙️ Engineering Implementation Review (B+)

### Strengths Identified by simulation-engineer:

**Advanced Rust Patterns:**
```rust
// Excellent trait design for extensibility
pub trait TerrainGenerator {
    type Config: Clone + Default;
    fn generate(&self, width: usize, height: usize, config: &Self::Config) -> Vec<Vec<f32>>;
}

// Scale-aware parameter derivation
impl ScaleAware for WaterFlowParameters {
    fn derive_parameters(&self, scale: &WorldScale) -> Self {
        // Parameters adjust based on physical scale
    }
}
```

**Sophisticated Multi-Physics Integration:**
- **76 passing tests** with comprehensive physics validation
- **7+ integrated environmental systems** (terrain, water, atmosphere, pressure, wind, temperature, climate)
- **Dimensional analysis validation** prevents unrealistic parameter combinations
- **CFL stability conditions** ensure numerically stable water flow simulation

### Performance Optimization Opportunities:

**High Priority:**
1. **Data Structure Optimization**: Convert `Vec<Vec<f32>>` to flat `Vec<f32>` for 2-5x performance improvement
2. **Incremental Updates**: Cache unchanged regions instead of full layer regeneration per tick
3. **Address 51 clippy warnings** for code quality improvements

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Spatial Partitioning**: Grid-based updates for maps >1000x1000 to avoid O(n²) scaling
5. **Parallel Processing**: Water flow and atmospheric calculations could benefit from rayon parallelization

## 🌍 World Generation Architecture Analysis

### (0,0) Mountain Artifact - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**world-generation-architect findings:**
- **Diamond-Square algorithm uses fixed corner values**: `[0.3, 0.7, 0.4, 0.6]`
- **Position (0,0) always receives first corner value (0.7)** - consistently high elevation
- **This creates deterministic mountain placement at grid origin**

### Recommended Solutions:

#### Option 1: Randomized Corner Initialization (Recommended)
```rust
pub fn randomized_corners(rng: &mut StdRng, base_elevation: f32, variation: f32) -> [f32; 4] {
    [
        base_elevation + rng.gen_range(-variation..variation),
        base_elevation + rng.gen_range(-variation..variation),
        base_elevation + rng.gen_range(-variation..variation),
        base_elevation + rng.gen_range(-variation..variation),
    ]
}
```

#### Option 2: Corner Influence Dampening
```rust
// Apply dampening factor based on grid size
let dampening_factor = (1.0 - (size as f32 / 1024.0).min(0.8)).max(0.2);
let adjusted_corner = base_corner_value * dampening_factor + 0.5 * (1.0 - dampening_factor);
```

### Algorithm Extension Opportunities:
