### âœ… Story 1.2.3: Atmospheric Pressure Memory Optimization
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Impact**: **Eliminated O(NÂ²) computational complexity in pressure generation**  
**Critical Optimization**:
- **Massive performance bug fixed**: Removed O(NÂ²) average temperature calculation
- **Before**: For each cell, calculated temperature average across ALL cells (N cells Ã— N operations = O(NÂ²))
- **After**: Pre-calculate average temperature once, use for all cells (1 operation = O(1))
- **Mathematical preservation**: Same thermal circulation physics, vastly improved performance

```rust
// BEFORE - O(NÂ²) catastrophic performance:
for y in 0..height {
    for x in 0..width {
        // This loop ran INSIDE the cell loop - O(NÂ²) disaster!
        for ty in 0..temperature_layer.height() {
            for tx in 0..temperature_layer.width() {
                temp_sum += temperature_layer.get_temperature(tx, ty);
                // ... calculated NÃ—N times instead of once!
            }
        }
    }
}

// AFTER - O(1) efficient calculation:
let avg_temperature = temperature_layer.get_average_temperature(); // Calculate once
for y in 0..height {
    for x in 0..width {
        // Use pre-calculated average - no nested loops
        let temp_deviation = temperature - avg_temperature;
        // ... rest of physics calculations
    }
}
```
