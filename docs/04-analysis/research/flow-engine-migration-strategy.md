# Flow Engine Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the systematic migration strategy for consolidating 5 duplicate flow implementations into the unified `FlowEngine` architecture. The migration prioritizes maintaining system stability while eliminating physics inconsistencies and enabling missing cross-system couplings.

## Analysis of Duplicate Implementations

### 1. `sim.rs:316-440` - Gradient-Based 8-Neighbor Flow
**Physics Approach**: Steepest descent with steady-state approximation `v = gradient × flow_rate`
**Strengths**: 
- Fast computation O(n) per cell
- Simple boundary handling
- Drainage network enhancement integrated
**Weaknesses**:
- Non-conservative (no mass balance)
- Ignores momentum physics
- Unrealistic instantaneous velocity response

### 2. `corrected_water_flow.rs:84-309` - Conservation-Based Shallow Water
**Physics Approach**: Momentum conservation with pressure gradients `∂v/∂t = -g∇h - v·∇v`
**Strengths**:
- Physically accurate shallow water equations
- Mass conservation tracking
- CFL stability conditions
- Proper drainage channel depth modeling
**Weaknesses**:
- Higher computational cost
- Requires stable timestep calculation
- More complex boundary conditions

### 3. `spatial_partitioning.rs:245-344` - Performance-Optimized Selective Flow  
**Physics Approach**: Change-tracking with selective cell updates
**Strengths**:
- Significant performance gains (processes only active cells)
- Convergence detection
- Maintains accuracy in active regions
**Weaknesses**:
- Complex implementation
- Change propagation edge cases
- Requires careful threshold tuning

### 4. `drainage.rs:170-414` - Static Drainage Network Analysis
**Physics Approach**: Topological sorting for flow accumulation calculation
**Strengths**:

- Pre-computed drainage pathways
- No iterative convergence required
**Weaknesses**:
- Static analysis only (no temporal dynamics)
- Assumes steady-state flow patterns
- Limited to single-direction flow per cell

### 5. `geological_evolution.rs` - Accelerated Flow for Geological Timescales
**Physics Approach**: Uses existing systems with modified parameters (`flow_rate = 0.2`)
**Strengths**:

- Appropriate time-scale adjustments
**Weaknesses**:
- Inherits inconsistencies from base implementations
- Parameter tuning without physics justification
