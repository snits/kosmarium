## Next Priority Actions

### Remaining Physics Foundation Tasks (High Priority)
**Dimensional Analysis and Grid Convergence** (complete current physics work)
- Add dimensional analysis with proper physical units (mm/h, m³/s, etc)
- Implement grid convergence testing framework for scaling validation
- These complete the professional-grade numerical simulation foundation

### Phase 2A: Environmental Foundation Systems (Next Major Phase)
**Temperature/Climate Layer Implementation** (recommended next major development)
- Pre-computed base temperature layer from elevation + latitude
- Dynamic seasonal effects and weather patterns
- Integration with water system (temperature-dependent evaporation)
- Scale-aware climate parameter derivation using WorldScale architecture
- See `docs/phase-2-environmental-systems.md` for complete implementation plan

### Alternative Directions (If changing focus)
**Phase 2B: Large-Scale Flow Effects** (advanced physics)
- Coriolis effect simulation for large maps
- Atmospheric pressure and wind systems
- Geostrophic flow patterns

**Phase 2C: Terrain Generation Experiments** (different direction)
- Implement Generalized Stochastic Diffusion (GSD) algorithm
- Multi-algorithm terrain generation system

### Technical Architecture Status

### Key Decisions Made This Session
- **Rendering Strategy**: TUI-first with migration-ready architecture (ADR-010)
- **Multi-backend assessment**: Avoid complexity, migrate cleanly when needed
- **Technical roadmaps**: 4-phase development plan from experts (Environmental → Climate → Agents → Culture)

### Expert Consensus Summary
- **✅ Professional water flow physics complete** - Scale-aware system with CFL stability and physics-based scaling
- **✅ Architecture validation** - WorldScale and ScaleAware patterns proven through complex implementation
- **Phase 2 environmental systems ready** - Temperature/climate layer is natural next progression
- **Maintain TUI focus** until 3-4 layers + real-time requires graphics migration
- **Physics foundation solid** - CFL stability and scaling laws match professional simulation practices

### Implementation Readiness
- **Codebase**: Fully functional with professional TUI interface

- **Next steps**: Multiple implementation paths available with expert guidance

### Development Philosophy
- **Focus on simulation mechanics** over graphics complexity
- **TUI skills are valuable** for broader game development and tools
- **Educational goals**: Terminal interface forces focus on core mechanics
- **Migration when needed**: Clean transition path architected, not premature optimization
