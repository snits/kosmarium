- ✅ Comprehensive technical roadmaps documented
- ✅ Rendering strategy analysis and architecture decision (TUI-first, migration-ready)

## Next Priority Actions

### Immediate Implementation Options (Next Session)
**Phase 1A: Water Flow System** (simulation-engineer + world-generation-architect recommendation)
- Implement WaterFlowSystem with basic water physics
- Add WaterLayer to simulation state
- Create simple erosion mechanics
- Extend TUI to visualize water flow

**Phase 1B: TDD Implementation** (CLAUDE.md workflow requirement)
- Implement test-specialist guided comprehensive test coverage
- Add unit tests for Diamond-Square generation
- Integration tests for TUI interaction
- Performance benchmarks for large map generation

**Phase 1C: Advanced Terrain Experiments** (remaining todos)
- Try different initial corner configurations for terrain variety
- Experiment with map aspect ratios and edge effects
- Add more elevation bands and terrain types
- Implement basic climate/temperature layers

### Medium Term (Next 2-4 Sessions)
**Phase 2: Environmental Foundation**
- Implement Generalized Stochastic Diffusion (GSD) algorithm
- Add climate simulation pipeline (temperature, precipitation)
- Biome assignment using Whittaker classification
- Multi-layer environmental visualization in TUI

### Technical Architecture Status
- **Simulation Engine**: Ready for implementation (detailed roadmap available)
- **Rendering Strategy**: TUI-first with migration-ready architecture decided
- **Expert Guidance**: All major technical decisions have comprehensive expert recommendations
- **Codebase Architecture**: Trait-based, modular, extensible foundation complete

## Handoff Notes for Next Session

### Context to Load
- **docs/technical-roadmaps.md**: Comprehensive implementation guidance from world-generation-architect and simulation-engineer
- **docs/architecture-decisions.md**: All major architectural decisions with expert rationale
- **docs/project-roadmap.md**: Updated with expert recommendations and priority phases
- Current TUI implementation in src/tui.rs is production-quality and extensible

### Key Decisions Made This Session
- **Rendering Strategy**: TUI-first with migration-ready architecture (ADR-010)
- **Multi-backend assessment**: Avoid complexity, migrate cleanly when needed
- **Technical roadmaps**: 4-phase development plan from experts (Environmental → Climate → Agents → Culture)
- **TUI value recognition**: Builds broadly applicable skills for roguelikes, prototyping, developer tools

### Expert Consensus Summary
- **Start with water flow system** (Phase 1A) as first dynamic simulation component
- **Maintain TUI focus** until 3-4 layers + real-time requires graphics migration
- **Architecture is excellent** for planned simulation evolution
- **All major technical decisions** have detailed expert guidance available

### Implementation Readiness
- **Codebase**: Fully functional with professional TUI interface
- **Architecture**: Modular, trait-based, extensible foundation complete
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical roadmaps and architectural guidance
- **Next steps**: Multiple implementation paths available with expert guidance

### Development Philosophy
- **Focus on simulation mechanics** over graphics complexity
- **TUI skills are valuable** for broader game development and tools
- **Educational goals**: Terminal interface forces focus on core mechanics
- **Migration when needed**: Clean transition path architected, not premature optimization
