# Session Handoff

ABOUTME: Current implementation status and next steps for session continuity
ABOUTME: Tracks active development state for smooth transitions between sessions

## Current Implementation Status

### Active Development State
- **Project Phase**: Initial prototype setup
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Last Session Focus**: Project initialization and documentation setup

### Known Issues Requiring Attention
1. **Compilation Error in worldgen.rs:21** - `gen` is a reserved keyword in Rust 2024 edition
   - Error: `expected identifier, found reserved keyword 'gen'`
   - Fix needed: Change `rng.gen::<f32>()` to `rng.gen::<f32>()` or use alternative method
   - Status: Blocking development

2. **Unused Mutable Variable** - Warning in main.rs:17
   - `mut sim` declared but never mutated
   - Non-blocking but should be cleaned up

### Recently Completed
- ✅ Project structure analysis
- ✅ CLAUDE.md documentation created
- ✅ Process documentation framework established
- ✅ docs/ directory structure created

## Next Priority Actions

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Fix compilation error in worldgen.rs to enable basic functionality
2. Clean up unused mut warning in main.rs
3. Verify project builds and runs successfully
4. Complete process documentation files

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. Implement actual Diamond-Square algorithm (currently placeholder random noise)
2. Add basic unit tests for worldgen module
3. Expand simulation structure for game state management
4. Consider adding command-line arguments for map size/seed

### Development Environment Status
- **Build Status**: ❌ Failing (compilation error)
- **Dependencies**: All resolved (rand 0.8, crossterm 0.27)
- **Test Coverage**: None implemented yet
- **Documentation**: Basic structure in place

## Handoff Notes for Next Session

### Context to Load
- Review worldgen.rs implementation approach
- Understand Diamond-Square algorithm requirements
- Consider simulation expansion strategy

### Key Decisions Made
- Chose modular architecture with clear separation (worldgen/sim/render)
- Selected crossterm for cross-platform terminal rendering
- Implemented seeded randomization for reproducible world generation
- Used elevation-based color mapping for terrain visualization

### Avoid These Approaches
- Don't mix rendering logic with simulation logic
- Don't hardcode map dimensions (should be configurable)
- Don't implement complex features before basic compilation is fixed
