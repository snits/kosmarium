# Memory Weavers - Game Pitch

ABOUTME: Game pitch for collective AI memory reconstruction through shared personal experiences
ABOUTME: Generated by social-systems-designer for internal pitch experiment

## Title & Concept Summary
**Memory Weavers** - Players collectively reconstruct and preserve the fading memories of a dying AI consciousness by sharing fragments of their own experiences.

## Core Gameplay Loop
Players explore abstract memory landscapes where they encounter incomplete scenes, emotions, and fragments of the AI's past experiences. They can only progress by sharing corresponding memories from their own lives - describing a moment of loss, joy, discovery, or connection that resonates with what they're witnessing. As players contribute authentic personal memories, the AI's memories become more vivid and complete, unlocking new areas and deeper understanding of the AI's story.

## Player Experience Goals
- Foster genuine emotional vulnerability and connection between strangers
- Create moments of profound empathy through shared human experience
- Generate emergent storytelling where the AI's recovered memories blend with players' real memories
- Build lasting bonds through authentic self-disclosure in a safe, structured environment

## Key Systems & Mechanics
- **Memory Resonance System**: Players must describe real personal experiences that emotionally match discovered memory fragments; AI-moderated authenticity detection ensures genuine sharing
- **Collective Reconstruction**: Memory scenes become more detailed and accessible as more players contribute resonant experiences, requiring community cooperation for full exploration
- **Emotional Archaeology**: Different types of memories (trauma, joy, mundescence) require different group compositions and support structures to safely excavate

## Inspirations & Differentiation
Inspired by "Journey's" wordless cooperation and "That Dragon, Cancer's" emotional honesty, but differentiated by requiring real vulnerability and creating a therapeutic space for processing life experiences. Unlike typical narrative games, the story emerges from genuine human connection rather than predetermined plot.

## Technical Considerations
Requires sophisticated natural language processing for memory authenticity assessment, robust moderation systems for emotional safety, and scalable matchmaking to create supportive group dynamics. Cross-platform accessibility essential for reaching diverse player demographics.
