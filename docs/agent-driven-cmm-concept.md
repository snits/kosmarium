# Agent-Driven Capabilities Maturity Model (CMM) Development

ABOUTME: Conceptual framework for implementing formal organizational development processes through agent orchestration
ABOUTME: Builds on existing instruction-driven agent architecture to enable systematic process maturity advancement

## Core Insight

Our current agent instruction system (CLAUDE.md + specialized agent files) provides the perfect foundation for implementing formal Capabilities Maturity Model development through agent orchestration. If agents can reliably follow complex development workflows, they can implement organizational improvement processes.

## Current Foundation

**Existing Architecture:**
- **CLAUDE.md**: Core workflow requirements, quality gates, agent coordination protocols
- **Agent instruction files**: Specialized roles with detailed behavioral specifications  
- **Structured processes**: TDD, code review approval, atomic commits, quality enforcement
- **Proven compliance**: Agents successfully follow complex, multi-step workflows

## Proposed Extension: Agent-Driven CMM
