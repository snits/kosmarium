=== THERMAL-PRESSURE COUPLING ANALYSIS ===
Scale: 100x50, 10km physical size
Heightmap: 100x50 flat terrain (elevation = 0.0)
Temperature gradient applied: 30°C (left) → 10°C (right)

=== TEST POINT ANALYSIS ===
Warm side (x=10): 28.0°C, 101306 Pa
Cool side (x=90): 12.0°C, 101330 Pa

=== VARIATION ANALYSIS ===
Temperature difference: 16.0°C (57.14%)
Pressure difference: 24 Pa (0.0237%)
Pressure/Temperature ratio: 0.0004

=== PHYSICS VALIDATION ===
Physics correct (warm air = lower pressure): true

=== TEST EXPECTATION ANALYSIS ===
Expected pressure variation range: 0.5714% to 114.29%
Actual pressure variation: 0.0237%
❌ FAIL: Pressure variation 0.0237% is too weak (< 0.5714%)
