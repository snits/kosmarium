# Design Documentation

ABOUTME: Game design, UX specifications, and visual direction for the planetary simulation
ABOUTME: Covers user experience patterns, interaction design, and creative direction

## Directory Contents

This directory contains design specifications and creative direction documents organized by category:

### Design Categories

#### `ux-design/` - User Experience Design
- **User flows and interaction patterns**: How users navigate and interact with the simulation
- **Interface specifications**: Layout, controls, and user interface requirements  
- **Multi-viewport TUI design**: Terminal user interface specifications and navigation systems
- **Scientific viewport UX**: Specialized user experience for scientific analysis workflows

#### Root Level Design Documents
- **Cultural and world-building systems**: Fantasy physics, mythology engines, and world generation systems
- **Creative technical specifications**: Innovative approaches combining technical implementation with creative vision

### Design Philosophy

The planetary simulation design emphasizes:

1. **Educational accessibility**: Complex scientific concepts made approachable through intuitive interfaces
2. **Scientific authenticity**: Realistic physics and atmospheric modeling with educational value
3. **Terminal-first approach**: Professional-quality experience within terminal constraints
4. **Scalable complexity**: Interface grows with system complexity without overwhelming users

### Integration with Other Systems

Design specifications coordinate with:
- **01-architecture/**: Technical feasibility and implementation constraints
- **03-implementation/**: Development roadmaps and implementation progress  
- **04-analysis/**: Research findings that inform design decisions
- **05-process/**: Development workflows and quality standards

### Design Standards

All design documents should include:
- **User personas and use cases**: Who will use this feature and how
- **Interaction flows**: Step-by-step user journeys  
- **Technical constraints**: What the implementation can realistically support
- **Success metrics**: How to measure if the design achieves its goals
