# Drought Impact Study Configuration
# ==================================
# Long-term ecosystem stress analysis under reduced precipitation
# Recommended for multi-year drought impact research

mode: Research
custom_scaling_factor: 0.2  # 5x slower than realistic mode for extended timescales
scale_biological: true      # Focus on ecosystem stress response
scale_geological: false     # Geological processes not relevant for drought studies  
scale_atmospheric: true     # Include precipitation/evaporation changes

# Expected behavior with this configuration:
# - Ecosystem growth: ~0.5 kg/mÂ²/year (very slow, suitable for drought stress)
# - Vegetation changes: Multi-seasonal cycles visible
# - Simulation duration: Extended studies recommended (hours of real time)
# - Use case: Research publications on drought resilience and ecosystem recovery
