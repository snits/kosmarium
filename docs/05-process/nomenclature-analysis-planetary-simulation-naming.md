# Nomenclature Analysis: Planetary Simulation System Naming

ABOUTME: Systematic naming analysis for evolved planetary physics simulation project
ABOUTME: Evaluates current naming challenges and provides systematic naming recommendations

## Executive Summary

The project "sim-prototype" has evolved far beyond its original scope into a sophisticated **planetary physics simulation system** with comprehensive multi-scale modeling, educational applications, and scientific research capabilities. The current name fails to reflect the project's scientific rigor, educational value, and technical sophistication.

**Recommendation**: Adopt **"Planetaria"** as the primary system name, combining planetary science scope with accessibility and educational mission.

## Current Nomenclature Assessment

### Current Name Analysis: "sim-prototype"

**Strengths**:
- None for evolved scope

**Critical Weaknesses**:
- **Generic and uninspiring**: Could describe any simulation project
- **Suggests temporary/unfinished work**: "prototype" implies experimental status
- **No domain indication**: Provides no insight into planetary physics focus
- **Lacks educational context**: Missing the learning/research mission
- **Technical obscurity**: Doesn't communicate sophisticated capabilities

**User Mental Model Mismatch**:
- Scientists seeking research tools won't recognize advanced capabilities
- Educators looking for learning platforms miss educational value
- Technical users underestimate the multi-physics complexity
- General users see generic "prototype" rather than polished system

### Project Identity Analysis

**Core Identity Elements**:
1. **Planetary Scale Systems**: Global atmospheric, hydrological, geological modeling
2. **Scientific Rigor**: Physics validation, conservation laws, mathematical accuracy
3. **Educational Mission**: Learning through simulation, interactive exploration

**Semantic Analysis**:
- Combines "planetary" (scope) + "-arium" (place of learning/observation)
- Suggests comprehensive planetary knowledge system
- Implies both observation and interaction capabilities
- Natural pluralization for multiple instances/versions

**User Mental Model Alignment**:
- **Researchers**: "Professional planetary modeling platform"
- **Educators**: "Interactive planetary science learning environment"  
- **Students**: "Hands-on planetary exploration system"
- **Technical**: "Advanced planetary simulation framework"

### Tier 2 Options: Domain-Specific Alternatives

#### **Terra Dynamics**
**Strengths**: Clear physics focus, professional sound
**Weaknesses**: Less educational resonance, "Terra" Earth-specific

#### **Planetary Physics Studio**
**Strengths**: Combines all key elements explicitly
**Weaknesses**: Three words, less memorable, verbose

#### **Geosphere Interactive**
**Strengths**: Interactive emphasis, scientific terminology
**Weaknesses**: "Geo" suggests geology-only, less planetary scope

#### **Climate Atlas Engine**
**Strengths**: Research tool implication, comprehensive scope
**Weaknesses**: "Engine" technical, "Climate" narrow vs. multi-physics

### Tier 3 Options: Creative Alternatives

#### **Gaia Lens**
**Strengths**: Holistic system view, educational "lens" metaphor
**Weaknesses**: "Gaia" hypothesis associations may limit scientific adoption

#### **Planetary Observatory**
**Strengths**: Research facility implication, observation focus
**Weaknesses**: Suggests passive observation vs. interactive simulation

## Implementation Recommendations

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Internal Adoption (Immediate)
- Update repository name from `sim-prototype` to `planetaria`
- Revise all documentation headers and project descriptions
- Update `Cargo.toml` project name and binary names
- Modify README and project overview materials

### Phase 2: External Communication (1-2 weeks)
- Update any external references or documentation
- Revise project descriptions in profiles and repositories
- Update communication materials and project summaries
- Begin using "Planetaria" in all new documentation

### Phase 3: Legacy Transition (Ongoing)
- Maintain compatibility with existing command patterns during transition
- Gradually update legacy references in commit messages and comments
- Phase out "sim-prototype" references in favor of "Planetaria"
- Update any external links or shared materials

## Long-Term Nomenclature Governance

### Naming Consistency Rules

**System Component Naming**:
1. All modules use "Planetaria" prefix for external APIs
2. Internal modules may use abbreviated forms for brevity
3. User-facing tools always use full "Planetaria" branding
4. Configuration files use `planetaria_` prefix for clarity

**Future Extension Guidelines**:
1. New features follow established "Planetaria [Component]" pattern
2. Specialized tools use descriptive suffixes: `planetaria-climate`, `planetaria-hydro`
3. Educational materials emphasize learning context
4. Research tools emphasize scientific accuracy and configurability

### Anti-Pattern Prevention

**Avoid These Naming Patterns**:
- Generic suffixes that don't add meaning ("Planetaria Tool", "Planetaria App")
- Overly technical jargon that obscures educational accessibility
- Marketing buzzwords that compromise scientific credibility
- Platform-specific names that limit cross-platform adoption

## Conclusion

**Recommended Action**: Adopt "Planetaria" as the primary system name, implementing the migration strategy outlined above.

**Rationale Summary**:
1. **Clear domain indication**: Immediately communicates planetary science scope
2. **Educational resonance**: Familiar planetarium association supports learning mission
3. **Scientific legitimacy**: Professional terminology appropriate for research contexts
4. **Memorability and distinctiveness**: Single word, easy to remember and pronounce
5. **Scalability**: Works across all target audiences and future development directions

The name "Planetaria" successfully bridges the gap between scientific rigor and educational accessibility while providing a distinctive identity that accurately reflects the project's sophisticated planetary physics simulation capabilities.
