- **[workflows/testing-standards.md](workflows/testing-standards.md)** - Testing requirements and physics validation standards
- **[workflows/documentation-standards.md](workflows/documentation-standards.md)** - Documentation organization and standards framework
- **[workflows/scaling-guidelines.md](workflows/scaling-guidelines.md)** - Scale-aware development guidelines

**Specialized Process Workflows:**
- **[workflows/solo-comprehensive-analysis-prompt.md](workflows/solo-comprehensive-analysis-prompt.md)** - Comprehensive analysis workflow template

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Mathematical Validation First
**Status**: Proven with atmospheric physics transformation

**Mandatory Process**:
```bash
# 1. SageMath mathematical analysis before implementation
touch [system]_physics_validation.sage
sage [system]_physics_validation.sage

# 2. Derive safety parameters and validate conservation laws
# 3. Implement with diagnostic validation framework
# 4. Comprehensive testing with physics validation
```

**Results**: Prevented 4 major implementation bugs in atmospheric system

### 2. Code-Reviewer Approval Protocol (MANDATORY)
**ALL code changes require code-reviewer approval BEFORE committing**

**Process Requirements**:
- Maximum increment: Single logical change (15-30 minutes of work)
- STOP after each logical increment and request review
- NEVER proceed without explicit code-reviewer approval
- Atomic commits with clear functional scope

### 3. Quality Gate Requirements (Pre-Commit Checklist)

**Mandatory for every commit**:
```bash
cargo fmt                # Code formatting
cargo clippy            # Linting and best practices
cargo check            # Type checking and compilation
cargo test              # Unit and integration tests

# Physics system validation (when applicable)
cargo run --bin debug_[system]_validation
```

### 4. TDD Workflow for Physics Systems
**Based on atmospheric physics success**:

1. **Write failing test** that validates desired physics behavior
2. **Run test** to confirm failure with specific metrics
3. **Implement** minimum code to pass physics validation
4. **Request code-reviewer approval**
5. **Refactor** if needed while maintaining physics quality
6. **Document** patterns and lessons learned

## Testing Standards Framework

### Physics System Testing Requirements

**Mathematical Validation Testing**:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_conservation_laws() {
    // Quantitative conservation validation
    assert!(boundary_flux.abs() < 1e5, "Mass conservation violation");
}

#[test]
fn test_physical_realism() {
    // Realistic parameter ranges validation
    assert!(wind_speed < MAX_REALISTIC_WIND, "Unphysical wind speed");
}
```

**Scale-Aware Testing**:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_scale_independence() {
    // Same physics quality across 1km-40,000km domain range
    for domain_size in [1.0, 100.0, 1000.0, 40000.0] {
        let scale = WorldScale::new(domain_size, (50, 50), DetailLevel::Standard);
        validate_physics_quality(&system, &scale);
    }
}
```

**Diagnostic Framework Integration**:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_diagnostic_validation() {
    let validation = validate_geostrophic_balance(&system, &pressure, &wind);
    assert!(validation.pressure_wind_correlation > 0.8);
    assert!(validation.average_balance_residual < 5.0);
}
```

## Documentation Standards

### Required Documentation Elements

**ABOUTME Headers (MANDATORY)**:
```rust
// ABOUTME: Brief description of file purpose in 1 line
// ABOUTME: Key technical details or architectural role in 1 line
```

**Physics System Documentation Requirements**:
- Mathematical foundations and implementation details
- Validation metrics and improvement results
- Implementation approach and phase results
- Session continuity documentation

### Documentation Lifecycle Management

**Living Documents**: Update in place with clear change tracking
**Point-in-Time Records**: Never modify after creation
**Cross-Reference Standards**: Use relative paths for portability
**Version Control**: Use git for version history, not filename versions

## Performance & Security Standards

### Physics System Performance
- **Diagnostic overhead**: <10% impact on simulation performance
- **Scale performance**: No degradation when scaling domain size 10x
- **Memory efficiency**: Use PhysicsGrid for 2-3x improvement on vector operations

### Numerical Safety Standards
- **Division by zero protection**: Use safety thresholds (e.g., F_THRESHOLD = 1e-6)
- **Overflow prevention**: Realistic bounds on all physical quantities
- **Stability validation**: Verify numerical stability across parameter ranges

### Memory Safety Requirements
- **Bounds checking**: All array accesses validated
- **No unsafe code**: Use safe Rust patterns exclusively
- **Resource management**: Proper RAII and ownership patterns

## Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format
```

- Use F_THRESHOLD = 1e-6 s⁻¹ for numerical stability
- Achieve 63% wind speed reduction (50 → 18.6 m/s average)
- Perfect pressure-wind coupling (0.990 correlation)

## Experimental Development Guidelines

### Experiment-Friendly Standards

**Encouraged Practices**:
- Leave TODO comments for future exploration
- Commit experimental code with proper review
- Try multiple approaches to problems
- Use debugging tools during development

**Context Management**:
- Large debug outputs: Use logging or file output
- Analysis scripts: Write detailed data to files, summaries to stdout
- Agent debugging: Preserve context tokens for reasoning

**Must Avoid**:
- Breaking the build (prevents others from experimenting)
- Committing without code-reviewer approval
- Large commits mixing multiple experiments
- Deleting experiments without documenting learnings
