# Agent Collaboration Templates Index

ABOUTME: Directory index for document templates used in agent collaboration experiments
ABOUTME: Provides standardized structures for different types of agent tasks and collaboration patterns

## Available Templates

### Collaborative Evaluation Template
**File**: `collaborative-evaluation-template.md`
**Purpose**: Multi-agent collaborative evaluation and ranking tasks
**Features**: 
- Individual agent scratchpads for independent analysis
- Tagged collaborative synthesis sections
- Attribution tracking for contributions
- Consensus building framework
- Methodology observation notes

**Best Used For**:
- Ranking and evaluation tasks
- Comparative analysis requiring diverse perspectives
- Decision-making processes
- Cross-domain expert consultation

### Solo Analysis Template  
**File**: `solo-analysis-template.md`
**Purpose**: Deep individual analysis and technical specification tasks
**Features**:
- Comprehensive analysis structure
- Technical specification sections
- Implementation roadmap framework
- Risk assessment methodology
- Resource requirement planning

**Best Used For**:
- Technical design specifications
- Complex synthesis tasks
- Implementation planning
- Detailed architectural analysis

## Template Usage Guidelines

### Selecting the Right Template

**Use Collaborative Evaluation Template when**:
- Task benefits from diverse expert perspectives
- Evaluation or ranking is the primary goal
- Cross-domain validation is important
- You want to observe collaborative dynamics

**Use Solo Analysis Template when**:
- Deep technical synthesis is required
- Everything must integrate into coherent whole
- Complete, production-ready deliverables needed
- Complex analysis with sustained reasoning required

### Template Customization

Templates are designed to be **customized for specific tasks**:
- Add or remove sections based on task requirements
- Modify evaluation criteria for domain-specific needs
- Adjust agent roles and expertise areas
- Include task-specific instructions or constraints

### Experimental Considerations

**Attribution and Analysis**:
- Collaborative templates enable tracking individual vs. group contributions
- Solo templates provide comprehensive individual capability assessment
- Both templates support post-analysis experimental evaluation

**Workflow Management**:
- Templates provide structure to prevent workflow hierarchy issues
- Clear sections ensure all perspectives get captured
- Attribution tagging prevents perspective marginalization

## Template Development

### Version Control
- Templates should be versioned as they evolve
- Document changes and improvements based on experimental results
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

### Future Template Ideas
- **Rapid Brainstorming Template**: For creative ideation tasks
- **Technical Review Template**: For code review and quality assessment  
- **Consensus Voting Template**: For formal ranking aggregation
- **Sequential Analysis Template**: For building analysis step-by-step
- **Domain-Specific Templates**: Customized for security, UX, performance, etc.

### Contributing Template Improvements
- Test templates in real agent collaboration experiments
- Document what works well and what needs improvement
- Suggest modifications based on experimental observations
- Share insights about template effectiveness
