## A Note From the Human Participant

This is a project that began as an attempt to explore code assist technology, and the use of agents in particular. The beginning of that journey along with other agentic
shenanigans is documented in my [Code Assisted](https://snits.github.io/code-assisted/) blog. The numerous documents, including the rest of this README, are the product of
agent prompt files running on the Claude Sonnet 4 model. Take their claims with a fair bit of ðŸ§‚. I don't know what the long term goal of this project is, as
it began with no real goal other than seeing what the model and agents would do. It has been an interesting, fun, frustrating, and enlightening experience. Hopefully
it will provide some entertainment to you. There is still work to be done, but there are some truly useful things in the project. In particular I liked the initial idea
of having the program dump an ascii representation of the map to stdout so the model and agents could easily "see" the output, and then extending that with the idea
of an ascii "framebuffer" - just doing the same thing, but at an interval so they could observe the system model behaviors, which seemed to work much better than
having them try to interpret a screenshot image. There are still some issues to work out - some due to bugs, and others due to the limitations of their trying to jam
planetary physics into a little 2d continental scale box. They have plans somewhere in there on transitioning to a 3d system, but we'll see when that happens. They also
have grand designs for the agent portion of the engine as well. You can assume all of the commits are pretty much the work of the model and agents, and any fault with
it lies with me the human involved in this endeavor.
